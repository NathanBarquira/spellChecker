# spellChecker

This is a project I decided to start in the summer of 2022, my Junior year summer.

Background:
My first year of coding classes was purely in Python and my second year ended being purely in C++.
I had taken an intro data structures and algorithms class and I wanted to practice my skillls, so I 
decided to create a spell checker utilizing a self-implemented linked list and set (using a hash 
table as its underlying data structure).

How to Use:
* If not compiled already, you can compile using the makefile provided in the code
* If the precompiled file (main) cannot be run in your operating system, delete the main file and
  then recompile.
* The "main.cpp" file is the main file to run
* once running the main.cpp file, you will be provided with a series of std::cout outputs that will
  tell you what you have to do next.
